   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "Using logging messages is generally considered better than using print() statements for displaying messages in production code for several reasons:<br>\n",
    "1. Flexibility: Logging allows for more flexibility in managing log messages. We can easily enable or disable logging messages globally or on a per-module basis, change the logging level to control the verbosity of messages, and route log messages to different log outputs (e.g., files, streams, syslog, etc.) based on configuration settings. This provides more control and adaptability in managing log messages compared to print() statements, which are typically scattered throughout the code and can be harder to manage and modify.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "2. Granularity: Logging allows for different levels of log messages (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL), which provide varying levels of detail and severity. This allows we to log different types of messages at different levels, and selectively enable or disable certain levels of messages based on the desired logging configuration. With print() statements, We have limited control over the level of detail or severity of the messages, as all messages are typically displayed in the same way.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "3. Maintainability: Logging messages are more maintainable compared to print() statements, as they can be easily managed and updated globally or on a per-module basis. We can easily disable or enable logging messages during development, testing, and production phases of the software lifecycle, without modifying the code itself. On the other hand, print() statements may need to be manually added, removed, or modified throughout the code, which can be time-consuming and error-prone, especially in large codebases.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "4. Production-readiness: Logging is designed for production-ready code and follows best practices for logging and error handling. Logging messages are typically more structured and formatted, allowing for easier analysis, monitoring, and troubleshooting of issues in production environments. Logging also provides features such as logging levels, timestamps, log rotation, and log aggregation, which are essential for managing logs in production systems. print() statements, on the other hand, are typically used for temporary debugging or development purposes and may not adhere to best practices for logging in production environments.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "5. Performance: Logging can be more efficient in terms of performance compared to print() statements, especially when logging is disabled or configured to a lower logging level. In such cases, logging messages are not emitted, and the overhead of logging is minimal. print() statements, on the other hand, are executed every time they are encountered in the code, and their performance impact can be higher, especially in performance-critical sections of the code."

These buttons are used to control the execution of a program during debugging and allow developers to navigate through the code and inspect variables and data at different points in the program's execution.<br>\n",
    "1. **Step Over**: The Step Over button is used to execute the current line of code and move to the next line, without stepping into any function or method calls that may be encountered on the current line. If the current line contains a function or method call, the Step Over button will execute the entire function or method call as a single step, without stepping into the code of the function or method. This is useful when we want to skip over the details of a function or method call and continue to the next line of code in the current scope.\n",

This is useful when we want to step into the code of a function or method and inspect its behavior and variables.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "3. **Step Out**: The Step Out button is used to step out of the current function or method being executed and move to the line of code immediately after the function or method call. When the Step Out button is clicked, the debugger will continue the execution of the program until it reaches the end of the current function or method, and then move to the next line of code in the current scope.
