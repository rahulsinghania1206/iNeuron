This form allows you to handle different exceptions differently and provide appropriate error handling or recovery mechanisms.\n",

It is used to ensure that certain conditions or assumptions are met during program execution. If the condition evaluates to false, it indicates a bug or unexpected behavior in the code. The assert statement is similar to an if statement with an associated error-handling block, but it is typically used for situations that should never occur in correct code."

The with statement provides a convenient way to ensure that resources are properly acquired and released, even in the presence of exceptions. The as keyword is used to assign the resource to a variable within the context, allowing you to work with the resource within the indented block. After the block is executed, the resource is automatically released or cleaned up, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not.\n",

    "The with/as argument is similar to the try-finally statement combination, but it provides a more concise and readable syntax for managing resources and ensures proper cleanup without explicitly using a finally block."
