    "An abstract superclass is a class that is designed to be inherited by other classes, but it cannot be instantiated on its own. It serves as a blueprint for other classes and provides common attributes and behaviors that can be shared among its subclasses. An abstract superclass typically contains abstract methods, which are methods without an implementation. Subclasses are required to provide their own implementation for these abstract methods."

    "To augment an inherited method instead of completely replacing it, you can use method overriding. Method overriding allows a subclass to provide its own implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. By defining a method with the same name in the subclass, the subclass's method will be called instead of the superclass's method when invoked on an instance of the subclass. However, the subclass can choose to invoke the superclass's method within its own implementation using the super() function. This way, the subclass can extend or modify the behavior of the inherited method while still utilizing the superclass's implementation."
