A module is a file containing Python code, while a class is a construct within that code that defines a blueprint for creating objects. Modules serve as containers for classes and other code, providing a way to organize and reuse functionality across different parts of a program. Classes defined within a module can be imported and used in other modules or scripts."

You should understand how to define classes, create instances (objects), access attributes, and invoke methods.\n",
